# HyperFind

HyperFind is a GUI client application for performing search on non-indexed data in [OpenDiamond](http://diamond.cs.cmu.edu/) system. It is primarily designed to search images but can also be used for other data types.


## Prerequisites

Install jdk: **It's strongly recommended to use `openjdk-8-jdk`.** Using JDK version >8 may not work.

Install `ant`.

Install `opendiamond.jar` following steps at [cmusatyalab/opendiamond-java](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/opendiamond-java)

## Clone and Get Third-party libraries

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cmusatyalab/hyperfind.git
cd hyperfind
lib/get-lib.sh
```

## Compile

```bash
ant
```

## Launch the GUI

```bash
./hyperfind.sh
```

### Preconditions for Launching the GUI

HyperFind looks for certain files under `$HOME/.diamond/`. If any of the following is missing, HyperFind may refuse to start.

+ `$HOME/.diamond/NEWSCOPE`: a [ScopeCookie](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/opendiamond/wiki/ScopeCookie) typically 
generated by a scope server or by the `cookiecutter` script from [OpenDiamond](http://diamond.cs.cmu.edu/).

+ `$HOME/.diamond/codecs/*.codec`: HyperFind looks for codecs here.

+ `$HOME/.diamond/predicates/*.pred`: HyperFind looks for predicates here.

+ `$HOME/.diamond/filters/*`: HyperFind looks for filters referenced in codecs or predicates here.

Typically, codecs/predicates/filters come in a bundle developed separately.

*For definitions of `codec`, `predicate` and `filter`, see https://github.com/cmusatyalab/opendiamond/wiki/StructureOfDiamond .*


## Tips

### Viewing ScopeCookie
[Recommended] If you have OpenDiamond installed locally:
```bash
python -m opendiamond.scope $HOME/.diamond/NEWSCOPE
```

The ScopeCookie is a base64-encoded string containing the authorized search servers, data sources and expiration time.

Alternative:
```bash
cat $HOME/.diamond/NEWSCOPE | grep -v \- | base64 -d
```

### Auto placing ScopeCookie (Linux Only)
Installing OpenDiamond on your computer will also install a system hook that automatically renames and places
the ScopeCookie properly when you double-click the downloaded file from the browser.

### Obtaining filters
The common type of downloadable filters (short for saying codecs/predicates/filters) is
a tar ball containing the directories `codec/`, `predicate/` and `filter/`.
Decompress the tar ball and place files under `$HOME/.diamond/` as mentioned above.

### Running HyperFind remotely with X11 forwarding
It has been successful to run HyperFind in a Linux host and forward the GUI to Windows/MacOS.
To do so, you should enable X11 forwarding in your SSH connection and install a X11 server on your OS
(e.g., Xming on Windows, Xquartz on MacOS).
