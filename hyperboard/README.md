# Hyperboard

Hyperboard is a "History Window Webapp" for tracking productivity in Eureka.

Generally, it is started automatically with hyperfind.
To start hyperboard by itself, run
./hyperboard LOGDIR PWD
where LOGDIR is the path to the log directory. If it is relative, it should be relative to PWD.
